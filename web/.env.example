# Example environment configuration for the web application
#
# Copy this file to .env.local and customize as needed
#
# For local development, you typically don't need to set these variables
# as assets are served from the local web/public directory

# CDN/Storage base URL for static assets (videos and map overviews)
# Examples:
#   Google Cloud Storage: https://storage.googleapis.com/your-bucket-name
#   AWS S3: https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
#   Azure Blob: https://youraccounst.blob.core.windows.net/container-name
#   Custom CDN: https://cdn.yourdomain.com
#
# VITE_ASSETS_BASE_URL=

# When set, the application will load large assets (videos and map overviews)
# from the specified URL instead of the local server.
#
# Leave commented out for local development to use local assets.
